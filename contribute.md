# Contributing to VulnVault

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **VulnVault** 🎉

This project exists to help developers build secure software through **clear, practical, and accurate guidance**. Contributions that improve clarity, correctness, or coverage are always welcome.

---

## What You Can Contribute

You can contribute by:

- Adding new vulnerabilities
- Adding new languages or frameworks
- Improving insecure / secure code examples
- Fixing inaccuracies or edge cases
- Improving documentation and explanations
- Aligning content with new standards or best practices

---

## Contribution Principles

When contributing, please follow these principles:

### ✅ Developer‑First
- Assume the reader is a developer, not a security specialist
- Explain *why* something is insecure, not just *that* it is

### ✅ Realistic Examples
- Use real‑world patterns seen in production code
- Avoid contrived or unrealistic examples

### ✅ Side‑by‑Side Comparisons
- Always show **❌ insecure** and **✅ secure** implementations
- Keep examples minimal and focused on the issue

### ✅ Framework‑Aware
- Follow idiomatic patterns for the language or framework
- Do not introduce unnecessary abstractions

---

## Structure Guidelines

### Vulnerability Content

Each vulnerability should include:

1. Description & Risk
2. How the Vulnerability Occurs
3. Insecure Example(s)
4. Secure Example(s)
5. Prevention & Best Practices
6. Relevant Standards (OWASP Top 10, ASVS, CWE)

### Code Examples

- Clearly label insecure vs secure code
- Include comments where helpful
- Avoid external dependencies unless required
